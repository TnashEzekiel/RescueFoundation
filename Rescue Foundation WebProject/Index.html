  <h3>Rescu Foundation</h3>
  <p>Rescu is a charitable organization which provides activities for physically and mentally handicapped people in a sheltered environment.  It was founded by parents who were concerned about facilities for their children as they became adults.</p>
  <p>The main activities of Rescu are work related and Rescu operates in a purpose built workshop in Harare. The beneficiaries of Rescu are also able to interact socially in a wider world than the confines of their home environment.</p>
  <p>Many charitable organizations have assisted Rescu over the years, including Rotary. Rotarians from the Rotary Club of Hunyani, are on the management committee of Rescu. Rescu provides and maintains wheelchairs, walking frames, crutches, and other mobility aids.</p>
  <p>In their workshops they undertake a wide variety of work for companies that wish to outsource. One such organisation is CHRISTIAN BLIND MISSION [CBM], which has been running a Mobility project for the past two years through Rescu. Instead of getting a wheelchair for the full price beneficiaries of the program are encouraged to make a small donation that will go towards the maintenance of the wheelchair.</p>
  <p>If however, a beneficiary has no source of income they will receive the wheelchair for free.</p>
