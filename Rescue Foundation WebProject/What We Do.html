<h4>WHO WE ARE</h4>
<p>The Hunyani Rotary Club has embarked on a project to supply prosthetic limbs through Rescu. Jaipur limbs are very effective low cost prosthetic legs, originally developed in India. Working with the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, Rescu is about to set up a centre to provide Jaipur Limbs for the whole of Zimbabwe.  This will complement the existing services for prosthetic limbs within the country.

The project will be managed by technically trained and registered personnel, but support work will be done by handicapped beneficiaries within Rescu. The Rotary Club of Hunyani has secured a grant of $58,000 from the Rotary Foundation for this project.
  
In common with many other organizations and companies, Rescu has been in a very difficult position during recent years.  But they have survived and  are ready for the future. They have exciting new plans to help within communities around Harare, from their base in town.  

The above projects are well underway but more funds are needed to make them effective. Currently the organisation needs a replacement pick-up and assistance with cost of materials for refurbishments. These will help them improve their capabilities for manufacture and service for companies.
<br>
<p>Any well wishers are welcome to <a href="ContactUs.html">Contact Us</a> or visit the centre which is at 21 Harare Street, Harare.</p>
